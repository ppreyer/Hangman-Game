# Hangman-Game: Super Smash Bros Version

## Overview
This is a Super Smash Brothers (N-64 animations) hangman application hosted on Github pages.
You can play the game here: https://ppreyer.github.io/hangman-game/

## Getting Started
Select a level difficulty and press any key to begin
You only need to press a letter once should it appear multiple times in the word.
During each game session, keys are stored in an array when pressed. The array is evaluated on each press. Repeated keys are ignored. A correct guess will reveal a letter(s), and incorrect guesses remove one from a user's total guesses left
The score is tracked throughout each game session.
The win/loss count is stored in the hangman object and displayed at the end of each game.
An image loads and a sound plays based on the outcome of the game.
A user can reset their score by clicking on the 'Reset' button.
